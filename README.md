### Getting started

- from the project root, run ```npm run install_all```
- then run ```npm run dev```
- while that is running, open a new tab (make sure it's in the same project directory) and run ```npm run server```

### Features

- Pure react app built with ES6, react-bootstrap, and some CSSTransition group
- Backend includes express + knex/sqlite3 database
- Uses modern tools like Webpack + babel to build
- No state management system like Redux because the scope of this project is so small
- Added some "loading gif" transitions as well as artifically long server response times (wrapped with a setTimeout) to demonstrate async state handling on the frontend
